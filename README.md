# Interesting Python Program

This Python program demonstrates various concepts such as variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and file I/O. The program manipulates an interest level variable, performs operations on it, and interacts with files for reading and writing.

## Project requirements

The project should:
1. Be hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Contain at least one variable.
3. Contain at least one conditional (`if/else`) statement.
4. Contain at least a function (`my_cool_func()`).
6. Have at least one `while` loop or one `for` loop.
7. Make use of either `import` or `read/write`.
8. Contain a README.md file with the description of your project.

## Features

- Defines an `interest_level` variable to represent the level of interest.
- Contains a function `check_interest(level)` to evaluate the interest level and provide feedback.
- Defines a function `double_interest(level)` to double the interest level.
- Utilizes a `for` loop to modify the interest level multiple times.
- Writes the final interest level to a file named `interest.txt`.
- Reads and displays the content of the `interest.txt` file.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `interesting_program.py` file.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `interesting_program.py`.
3. Run the program using the command: `python interesting_program.py`.
4. The program will display the updated interest level in each iteration and write the final interest level to a file.
5. The content of the file will be read and displayed.

## Example Output

```
Interest level after iteration 1: 10
Interest level after iteration 2: 20
Interest level after iteration 3: 40
Interest level from file: 40
```
